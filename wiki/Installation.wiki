Object Manager can be downloaded from the Downloads area. You will also need to download an  appropriate version of [http://developer.db4o.com/files db4o] (since db4o version 6.0, db4o and ObjectManager versions are synchronized, i.e. you should use ObjectManager 6.1 with db4o 6.1). Object Manager runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

Once you have downloaded the appropriate Object Manager build, create a folder called Object Manager in any location of your choice and unpack the downloaded zip file there.

The following instructions explain how to start Object Manager in different environments.
