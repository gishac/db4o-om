# Using the Ant script #

You can build Object Manager by running build.xml in objectmanager-swing folder (on Eclipse right click on build.xml (om-swing) and select "Run as Ant task"). The ready distribution package will appear in the same folder on completion and will be named $objectmanager-{dist.version}-java.zip

Additionally two intermediate folders will be created: classes and dist

Both directories and the zip file won't be removed by a "clean" so you'll have to remove them manually.
